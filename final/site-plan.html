			<h1>Mech Quest Index Site Plan</h1>
			<h2>Hayden Olson</h2>
			<h2>WDD 131-[section 1]</h2>
			<!-- In the header above, add the name or your site, your name and class number. For example if you are in section 3 you would put WDD 131.03 -->

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 2-3------------------------------ -->
			<hr />
			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>This will connect to the Mech Quest Website, which is an informational site for the video game I have been working on. These two pages will be indexes for the game. One will have information on the main characters and the other will have a list of some enemies and information on each one.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
      		<p>Older audience members who are searching for an open world adventure game to play. There may be mature themes, so 18+ may be the target audience. This sites purpose will be to create a community and spark interest for the game I wish to make. It could potentially become a kickstarter page once the game making process truly begins. Having an existing community can help projects like this lift off quickly.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>The main character page will have either a rotation select or some other sort of carousel/slideshow for the images of the main characters. The box to the right of it will flip on click and display information connected to the character at the front and center on the left of the box. For the enemy index, there will be a search feature to narrow down the results to the relevant text. There will be two boxes on the right. One that displays the picture of the selected enemy and the other will display all text information for the selected enemy.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<hr />
			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<h3>Website Logo</h3>
			<!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Character Index</h3>
			<p>[content, images, data for the home page] I still need to get the pictures from my brother. There will be 7 pictures, each being of each playable party member for the game.
				Rocket: 
				Character Stats:
				Rocket Propelled Bruiser
				Health: 10 (Level 1)
				Defense: 0
				Character Description:
				A young amnesiac boy who has a hefty golden robotic right arm. He is the heart of the team, having an unending amount of hope and courage. His general goofiness and cheeriness helps the team's general mood. He is also very reckless and moronic, often having no plan and charging into any situation fist first. He is the first to really establish the team, having a dream to explore the land as an adventurer and fight off bad guys.

				Waylon: 
				Character Stats:
				Slow and Steady Hard Batter
				Health: 10 (Level 1)
				Defense: 1
				Character Description:
				An adult adventurer who is the last remaining member in his guild. Somewhat strict and forlorn. He wields a bat and has a mean swing, but is rather sluggish with the equipment he has on. While Rocket joins and gives him a new team to travel with, he can't help but wonder where everyone in his old team went. He wonders if he was what drove everyone to leave. His wish is to travel the land and uncover what happened to his old team members, hoping they are still alive and well.

				Rex:
				Character Stats:
				Magic Caster
				Health: 15 (Level 1)
				Defense: -1
				Character Description:
				A timid Willow who wants to be useful. In spite of his intelligence, he often doubts himself. Is the main magic caster in the group, being able to cast a wide variety of elemental attacks with potent power. He originally joins Rocket to find his friend Dec in the Candy Woods, who entered and never returned. After losing everyone else in his village, he stays with Rocket in hopes of finding his people and freeing them. Hopefully, he can find more courage and self-confidence along the way.

				Dec:
				Character Stats:
				Inventive Artificer (and wanna-be Detective)
				Health: 15 (Level 1) / 30 (Level 1) with Rex
				Defense: -1
				Character Description:
				An overconfident Willow who believes he knows what he's doing, even when most of the time, he doesn't. Even if he comes off a bit too egotistical, he really does care for others and wants to help any person in need. He lacks real firepower with his magic since he severed his sacred tie to it, and instead uses the miniscule amount of magic he has left to create enhanced weapons. He will most often use a gun that fires elemental bullets. After being rescued in Candy Woods and after discovering the disappearance of his village, he joins Rocket with Rex and goes undercover with Rex in a trenchcoat. On top of rescuing his people, he also wants to become a great detective.

				Shredder:
				Character Stats:
				Ranged Slasher
				Health: 20 (Level 1)
				Defense: 0
				Character Description:
				A curious Candy Mecha who wishes to find a new and better purpose for himself. He is an efficient warrior, capable of ending battles in a single turn with his magnet blade that he can throw around like a boomerang. The biggest downside is an issue he is trying to overcome, his original programmed purpose to kill anything in sight. When overwhelmed in any situation, he switches into attack mode where he becomes a dangerous enemy for his allies. He joins Rocket in his quest after Rocket quite literally knocked his senses back in. He wishes to atone for the horrible things he cannot recall by becoming a hero with Rocket.

				Electro:
				Character Stats:
				Defensive DJ
				Health: 15 (Level 1)
				Defense: 1
				Character Description:
				A famous musician Mech who is taking a break from his career after a musical accident. He is a somewhat laid back being who is trying to better understand people after being disassociated from normal people in his life of fame. He lacks any real attack power, but his music can help boost team members and disrupt opponents. His mechanical form also somehow forms "holo" versions of things such as shields or clones from the music he plays. He joins Rocket to offer actual help after attempting to distract everyone from the inevitable issue at hand. He wishes to protect the common people who give his life purpose.

				Ribbon:
				Character Stats:
				Tempest Warrior
				Health: 30 (Level 1)
				Defense:
				Character Description:
				A royal guard in the Wraps pyramid who helped guard the red gem they dedicate their lives for. She is a bit too focused on the mission goal and lacks a real personality. She can be a bit intimidating and awkward in conversation. She wields a spear, but her real specialty comes from utilizing the nearby elements of the stage to turn the tables in combat. She can rearrange the stage and use some parts to throw at enemies. She was forced to join the team by the Queen to help them gather the three gems and check on Marvallo, their master. She has no real wish, but maybe she will develop her own desires after breaking out of the mold of her old life.

				<img src="#" alt="Cannon Canyon Background" />
				<img src="#" alt="Candy Woods Background" />
				#1 Shot
				<img src="pictures/Shot.png" alt="Photo of a Shot" />
				Health: 1
				Defense: 0
				Location: Cannon Canyon
				Tags: Normal, Creature, Shot, Enemy
				Description: Cannon shots fired by Cannon Troopers that came alive for some reason. They are very simple creatures that usually try to fend off others by bonking into them. 
				#2 Iron Shot
				<img src="#" alt="Photo of an Iron Shot" />
				Health: 1
				Defense: 4
				Location: Cannon Castle
				Tags: Steel, Creature, Shot, Enemy
				Description: The ironclad variant of a Shot. Due to their immense weight, they struggle to move around. They also can no longer jump, so they specialize in rolling. Countering is a great way to handle this foe.
				#3 Bubble Shot
				<img src="#" alt="Photo of a Bubble Shot" />
				Health: 4
				Defense: 0
				Location: Cavity Falls
				Tags: Water, Creature, Shot, Enemy
				Description: A floaty Shot. While it has a little more health than a normal Shot, this variant is unable to physically damage others. When it nudges into its foes, it soaks them and pushes them back a little bit.
				#4 Sugar Shot
				<img src="#" alt="Photo of a Sugar Shot" />
				Health: 3
				Defense: 0
				Location: Candy Woods
				Tags: Candy, Creature, Shot, Enemy

				<img src="pictures/Gold_Shot.png" alt="Photo of a Golden Shot" />
				Health: 5
				Defense: ???
				Location: Cannon Canyon
				Tags: Normal, Creature, Shot, Enemy
				Description: Similar to the Golden Cannon Trooper, this golden orb deals massive damage and only takes a single point of damage from any attack. Luckily its health is low, but taking it out in a single turn will not be easy. Additional gold is granted to those who best these ads. Daring adventurers have farmed riches from these foes.
				#6 Cannon Trooper
				<img src="pictures/Cannon_Trooper.png" alt="Photo of a Cannon Trooper" />
				Health: 4
				Defense: 0
				Location: Cannon Canyon
				Tags: Normal, Creature, Cannon Trooper, Enemy
				Description: Cannons with feet and the main inhabitants of Cannon Canyon. They usually sport a basic color hue and are plastic like. These beings live for battle and to improve their craft. This basic variety is in the beginning stage, full of potential but lacking in firepower. They believe in self strength, and find calling for help as a sign of weakness.
				#7 Iron Trooper
				<img src="#" alt="Photo of an Iron Trooper" />
				Health: 2
				Defense: 4
				Location: Cannon Castle
				Tags: Steel, Creature, Cannon Trooper, Enemy
				Description: An ironclad variant of the Cannon Trooper. Very slow and hefty. Normal attacks typically do no damage, so alternative means of damage may be needed to put a dent in them. Try countering their iron cannonballs.
				#8 Hydro Trooper
				<img src="#" alt="Photo of a Hydro Trooper" />
				Health: 8
				Defense: 0
				Location: Cavity Falls
				Tags: Water, Creature, Cannon Trooper, Enemy
				Description: A water filled Cannon Trooper that fires water. The water is harmless, so it is more of a nuisance than any real threat. This foe becomes a true danger when paired with electric and frost based enemies.
				#9 Sugar Trooper
				<img src="#" alt="Photo of a Sugar Trooper" />
				Health: 7
				Defense: 0
				Location: Candy Woods
				Tags: Candy, Creature, Cannon Trooper, Enemy

				Health: 20
				Defense: ???
				Location: Cannon Canyon
				Tags: Normal, Creature, Cannon Trooper, Enemy
				Description: An extremely rare, gaudy, and durable Cannon Trooper. To find one it to either be very fortunate, or extremely unfortunate depending on the adventurers preparedness and skill. They only ever take 1 damage for any and every hit. Either run, or counter all attacks. Riches to those who best this foe.
				#11 Stax
				<img src="#" alt="Photo of a Stax" />
				Health: 6
				Defense: 0
				Location: Cannon Canyon
				Tags: Normal, Creature, Stax, Enemy
				Description: A tower of colored blocks with basic eyes that shuffles around. One of the odd denizens created with the canyon. They love stacking together to stand taller than everyone else. Cannon Troopers love using them for target practice, so the Stax dislike them.
				#11 Hieroglyx
				<img src="#" alt="Photo of a Hieroglyx" />
				Health: 12
				Defense: 1
				Location: Wasteland
				Tags: Psychic, Earth, Creature, Stax, Enemy
				Description: Ancient clay blocks with hieroglyphs. Each glyph seem to grant some specific ability for the enemy team. Each block you break will remove the ability. This foe can create more blocks if not destroyed fast enough. Try dowsing them in water.
				#12 Jax
				<img src="#" alt="Photo of a Jax" />
				Health: 25
				Defense: 2
				Location: Jacks Place
				Tags: Steel, Dark, Creature, Stax, Enemy
				Description: A living stack of jacks with a ball on top. The vicious nature of Jacks Place has instilled an evil magic in this pile of spike balls. It takes joy in pelting others ruthlessly. The ball seems to be the weakpoint as it lacks defense.
				#13 Balleblaster
				<img src="#" alt="Photo of a Balleblaster" />
				Health: 10
				Defense: 0 - 1
				Location: Cannon Canyon
				Tags: Normal, Creature, Various, Enemy
				Description: The strangest being in Cannon Canyon. A pushdown detonator with one slinky arm that hops around. It attacks by exploding near opponents. This does not destroy the Balleblaster, as it then changes forms to a sort of ballerina, hence the name. The detonator box becomes a tutu and long womanish legs come out below. It then attacks with spin kicks and other leg related moves. It can return back into the box if it wants to explode again.
				#14 Balleslasher
				<img src="#" alt="Photo of a Balleslasher" />
				Health: 30
				Defense: 0 - 5
				Location: Charleton's Cove (Level 60 - 69)
				Tags: Normal, Creature, Various, Enemy
				Description: A weaponized variant of the Balleblaster. 
				#15 Birdy
				<img src="#" alt="Photo of a Birdy" />
				Health: 2
				Defense: 0
				Location: Cannon Canyon
				Tags: Flying, Creature, Various, Enemy
				Description: A speedy, wingless bird that isn’t even a bird. The birdy loves swooping down in hopes of being smacked. If it isn’t smacked, then the target is bonked. Is immune to counter damage, but makes for a great projectile.
				#16 Baseman
				<img src="#" alt="Photo of a Baseman" />
				Health: 7
				Defense: 0
				Location: Cannon Canyon
				Tags: Normal, Ground, Creature, Various, Enemy
				Description: An odd being that never reveals itself from under the flooring. The only part that is usually seen is their gloved hand that pops out. They lob various sports balls toward their opponent that have their own trajectory and speed. They’re a bit erratic in movement, seemingly teleporting to different tiles when they move.
				#17 Umpire
				<img src="#" alt="Photo of a Umpire" />
				Health: 21
				Defense: 4
				Location: Charleton's Cove (Level 60 - 69)
				Tags: Dark, Ground, Creature, Various, Enemy
				Description: A bulky, manlike magical being that is covered in protective sports gear. It wears a tile on its head, so there is speculation of this creature being related to the baseman. It is capable of going under the stage tiles and performing various devious stage actions. Physical attacks from this foe will sap energy from the opponent, so guard well. Light elemental attacks not only pierce its defense, but also deal massive damage.
				#18 Crasher
				<img src="#" alt="Photo of Crasher" />
				Health: 15 / 30
				Defense: 0
				Location: Cannon Town
				Tags: Normal, Human, Thug, Miniboss
				Description: A wild hoodlum who is a demomancer. Crasher attacks with bomb tosses that deal heavy damage.

Watch out for his high speed team attacks!
				#19 Pug
				<img src="#" alt="Photo of Pug" />
				Health: 24
				Defense: 0
				Location: Wasteland
				Tags: Normal, Human, Thug, Miniboss
				Description: A close friend of Crasher's. When he isn't running his punk fashion shop, he's hanging out with him. He is actually a pretty nice dude, but if Crasher takes issue with someone then Pug will help defend him. Pug will ride around on his motorbike and lob molotavs around. He is pretty defenseless without his bike.
				#20 Thug
				<img src="#" alt="Photo of Thug" />
				Health: 35
				Defense: 0
				Location: Wasteland
				Tags: Earth, Zobster, Thug, Miniboss
				Description: A zobster who has taken a liking to Crasher and Pug. As quiet as he is, his attack screams the loudest. He will grapple his opponent and self destruct. Explosions deal no damage to him, similar for Crasher. He will reform the next turn. Douse him in water!
				#21 Tank Trooper
				<img src="#" alt="Photo of a Tank Trooper" />
				Health: 100
				Defense: 4
				Location: Cannon Castle, Marvallo's Castle
				Tags: Normal, Cannon Trooper, MiniBoss
				Description: A frightening futuristic behemoth. It barely resembles a Cannon Trooper anymore with its vast upgrades. It functions as a rail gun that charges for a bit. While it charges, it attacks physically using its large body as a weapon. It will slam itself against surfaces wildly and recklessly. It has a charging bash it does with its spiked backside. Despite its large size, the fiend is fast and energized like a child on too much sugar. Avoid at all costs if you can.
				#22 Pirate
				<img src="#" alt="Photo of a Pirate" />
				Health: 5
				Defense: 0
				Location: Cavity Falls, Marlin's Tower
				Tags: Normal, Human, Thug, Enemy
				Description: A pirate from Marlin’s crew. These bandits specialize more in robbery than combat. They also seem to be doing this for fun, since they are armed with ridiculous objects for combat.
				#23 Captain Marlon
				<img src="#" alt="Photo of Captain Marlon" />
				Health: 20
				Defense: 0
				Location: Cavity Falls, Marlin's Tower
				Tags: Normal, Human, Thug, Legend, Miniboss
				Description: The pirate captain himself. Marlin is a dwarvish man with two peg legs and a big toothy smile. He competes against his co-captain frequently for fun. His weapon of choice is a marlin, aka a swordfish. He is quite agile, so keep on your toes.
				#24 Mecha Marlon
				<img src="#" alt="Photo of Mecha Marlon" />
				Health: 30
				Defense: 0
				Location: Marlin's Tower
				Tags: Normal, Mecha, Human, Thug, Legend, Boss
				Description: Marin’s special wooden pirate ship mecha. Pirate ship body with built in arms and legs and a painted smug grin on the front. It also wields a giant swordfish. Has similar moves to Marlin’s moveset, but with added giant based attacks and the rest of the crew pitching in as well.
				#25 Charleton the Insane
				<img src="#" alt="Photo of Charleton" />
				Health: 300
				Defense: 0
				Location: Charleton's Cove (Level 100)
				Tags: Dark, Psychic, Cursed, Monster, Legend, Superboss
				Description: The voice of influence. The invisible boogeyman who thrives in watching the world unfurl. This being only shows the odd mask that only shows two dots like a two for a dice, a hooked cane, white gloves, and a cape. Charlatan has made the cave of Cannon Canyon his personal lair and awaits one who can truly kill him. He cackles like a madman and is never quite where he seems to be. Charlatan fights like a rogue essentially, but has mastered psychic abilities and will combine the two skills to trick opponents. He will create illusions of himself, multiplying and hiding within a horde of himself. Electro can see through his tricks, so rely on his echolocation to highlight the real one. His cane can trip opponents, and can cause mental status effects. Once in a while, all damage will seem to heal him instead. Take the opportunity to heal up on those turns. Fend off the puppets of the supposed legendary heroes as well. The Rogue Hero wears a familiar mask…
				#26 Cider
				<img src="#" alt="Photo of a Cider" />
				Health: 6
				Defense: 0
				Location: Candy Woods
				Tags: Candy, Water, Creature, CandyFolk, Enemy
				Description: A candied spider that holds a vat of candy cider in its abdomen. It sprays its prey with the citric acid to dissolve them and drinks them up. Typically, its prey are other candied creatures. If the target is not candied, then it's not so bad. Just don’t let it get in your eyes. Ouch.
				#27 Sugar Sprite
				<img src="#" alt="Photo of a Sugar Sprite" />
				Health: 5
				Defense: 0
				Location: Candy Woods
				Tags: Candy, Spirit, Candyfolk, Enemy
				Description: These sugary spirits are born from the very woods. They are mischievous children with an insatiable curiosity. They eventually develop into one of the many creatures or residents of the woods. They lack a natural means of attacking, so they either play support or use dangerous weapons they randomly find.
				#28 Sugar Shinobi

				Defense: 0
				Location: Candy Woods
				Tags: Candy, Candymecha, Mech, Miniboss
				Description: The serial killer of the woods. You've got him surrounded! Make sure to heal other neural parties fighting him. Shredder specializes in wiping out individuals. His attacks will deal less damage the more people are still fighting, though he can sling his boomerang blade around to attack everyone at once. Water will dull his blade.
				#31 Candymecha
				<img src="#" alt="Photo of a Candymecha" />
				Health: 27
				Defense: 1
				Location: Abandoned Military Base
				Tags: Candy, Candymecha, Mech, Enemy
